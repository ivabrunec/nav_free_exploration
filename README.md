# Analysis of free exploration trajectories in virtual reality
 
 This repository contains jupyter notebooks with code to analyze navigation trajectories of participants freely exploring a virtual environment (Virtual Silcton). The analyses and simulated trajectories were generated in Python (see analysis and simulation folders), and the summary statistics and visualization were run in R (see summary folder; to run the notebook, you need an R jupyter kernel).

 These data were [published](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027722003493) in: Brunec, I. K., Nantais, M. M., Sutton, J. E., Epstein, R. A., & Newcombe, N. S. (2023). Exploration patterns shape cognitive map learning. Cognition, 233, 105360.
