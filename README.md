# Analysis of free exploration trajectories in virtual reality
 
 This repository contains jupyter notebooks with code to analyze navigation trajectories of participants freely exploring a virtual environment (Virtual Silcton). The analyses and simulated trajectories were generated in Python (see analysis folder), and the summary statistics and visualization were run in R (to run the notebook, you need an R jupyter kernel).
